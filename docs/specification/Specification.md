# Application Specification

## Problem Statement
It is very ineffective and disorganized when you go to make a meal and do not know all ingredients in your kitchen.
Our application aims to simplify the process by allowing the user to create a list of the things that they have in their 
kitchen and compare this to the ingredients required to make a dish. This will hopefully save the user time and create a 
more organized kitchen environment.
